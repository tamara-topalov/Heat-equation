## Parallel heat equation solver in CUDA 

Group project for the Concurrent and Distributed Computing course at Ecole Polytechnique. <br>

We use the finite differences method to solve the heat equation in 2D numerically. Computations are performed on a GPU, using the CUDA framework. See the project description for more details.
